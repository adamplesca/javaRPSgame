# Simple Java Rock Paper Scissor
Second Java project to remove the rust. Will be using concepts that I didn't use in my *javaSlotMachine* project (Hopefully).

# **HOW TO PLAY**
The player faces a *"bot"* (an array that gets shuffled each time the user picks an answer)

![bot player](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98d84731-8852-4d3c-ba11-9baf2f30b0eb)

The player will input whichever guess they want.

```
Rock
Paper
Scissors
```

Then the outcome will be shown, and kept track of.

To which the player can play as many times as wanted.
